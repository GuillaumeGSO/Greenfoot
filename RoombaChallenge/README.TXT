ROOMBA CHALLENGE!

Improve the "Roomba" implementation to go get your floors clean!

This scenario is adapted from Michael Kolling's 2007 Greeps Invasion.

Your task is to program the Roomba to get the floor as clean as possible.
You may ONLY CHANGE THE ROOMBA class. You may not change any other class.


The rules are:

Rule 1. Only change the class 'Roomba'. No other classes may be modified or 
    created.

Rule 2. You cannot move more than once per 'act' round. You may not call act() on yourself.

Rule 3. No long vision. You are allowed to look at the world only at the 
    immediate location of the Roomba. You only have the edge sensor, and the front, right, and left bumpers.

Rule 6. No creation of objects. You are not allowed to create any scenario 
    objects (instances of user-defined classes, such as another Roomba). Roombas 
    have no magic powers - they cannot create things out of nothing, except cleanliness.

Rule 7. No tele-porting. Methods from Actor that cheat normal movement (such as 
    setLocation) may not be used.
